### Huh I guess I can add a readme... Okay then!
Well, I should probably put up a little about me.

I'm a self taught Python developer. I've been working with Python since late 2018.
I don't know everything, and don't always use the best practices, but hey, sometimes the code works, what more can I ask for?

### Languages - In order of my confidence level:  
Python (General purpose)   
Kotlin (libGDX, PaperMC)  
Java (libGDX, PaperMC)  
C# (Unity)  
bash/zsh scripts  
JavaScript  
LOLCODE  
English  

Currently trying to learn Rust

~~I use Arch btw~~
