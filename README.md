### Huh I guess I can add a readme... Okay then!
Well, I should probably put up a little about me.

I'm a self taught Python developer. I've been working with Python since late 2018.
I don't know everything, and don't always use the best practices, but hey, sometimes the code works, what more can I ask for?

Recently I've tried to get into Java and using Spigot for Minecraft server plugins.
I also occasionally work in C# and Unity.

~~I use Arch btw~~
