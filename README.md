### Huh I guess I can add a readme... Okay then!
Well, I should probably put up a little about me.

I'm a self taught hobby programmer. I've been working with Python since late 2018, and have been learning other languages since.
I definitely don't know everything, and don't always use the best practices, but hey, sometimes the code works, and what more can I ask for?  
  
Working on too many projects, including a Minecraft server, a bunch of Minecraft client mods, a MUD, and a 2D space themed videogame.


### Languages - In order of my confidence level:  
Kotlin (libGDX, PaperMC, Fabric/Quilt) 
Python (General purpose)   
Java (libGDX, PaperMC)  
C# (Unity)  
Rust (Trying to learn Bevy)
bash/zsh scripts  
JavaScript  
LOLCODE  
English  

Currently trying to learn Rust, but the borrow checker and lifetimes are pain.

~~I use Arch btw~~
