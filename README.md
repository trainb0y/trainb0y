### Huh I guess I can add a readme... Okay then!
Well, I should probably put up a little about me.

I'm a self taught hobby programmer. I've been working with Python since late 2018, and have been learning other languages since.

I definitely don't know everything, and don't always use the best practices, but hey, sometimes the code works, and what more can I ask for?  
  
Working on entirely too many projects, including a bunch of Minecraft client mods, a [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_dungeon), and a 2D space themed videogame.


## Languages 
### Semi-Proficient(-ish)
Kotlin (libGDX, PaperMC, Fabric/Quilt)  
Python  
Java (libGDX)  
C# (Unity, Godot)  
GDScript (Godot)  
### Learning
Rust (Bevy)  
C++
### Terrible
English (words are hard:tm:)

~~I use Arch btw~~
